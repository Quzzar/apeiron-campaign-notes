### Quantum Entanglement

Using a Kalvix Estimation Processor (KEP), large facilities (known as ICFs - Interstellar Communication Facility) would read a single entangled particle as it flips - creating a binary signal that travels instantaneously across the traveled-galaxy.

Overtime KEPs were optimized and shrank in size and upkeep costs but the single entangled particle became the biggest issue to the technology.

The technology relied on the two entangled particles having an isolated wave function from the universe around it. If either particle ever became observed of affect by anything around it, the particle's wave function would collapse / merge and a new particle would need to be shipped across the galaxy.

A local ICF is an ICF that contains an entangled particle whose end particle is not in another system but within the same system. It's best for quick planet-to-plant communication.

* **Complete Communication Collapse (CCC)** - If the single entangled quark touches or interacts with anything, its wave function would collapse. Ending all communication. A new entangled quark would have to be acquired from light-years away. This is one of the worst things that could occur to a solar system.

Because each particle itself was precious in this technology, for quite a while quantum teleportation and quantum reconfiguration was very much out of the realm of possibility.

* **Quantum Reconfiguration** - Sure, you could flip the right quarks to turn Hydrogen into Tennessine but the process would take more time and energy than the process of just producing Tennessine outright would.

* **Quantum Teleportation** - More difficult than Quantum Reconfiguration, Quantum Teleportation is still a possibility but it still seem as far too difficult. Brings up more moral questions about individualism than anything else.

### Transmuting Spacetime

A very complex field of mathematics that requires having a solid grasp of actually understanding how dimensions work. Unfortunately, most species can't really comprehend anything beyond the 3rd dimension - most notably Humans. And it was for that reason why cracking this technical feat took such a long time, it required Humans to no longer be on the center stage and forefront of innovation.

It takes about 30 years to built a warpgate once the materials are all together. In that time, many people will be buying property, planning construction projects, researching profitable regions in the system, and setting themselves up for when the warpgate is constructed so that they can make a bunch of money.

As a result, once the gate is complete there's about a 50 year waitlist for the queue to go through and the price is outrageously expensive.


### The Internet

Any system that has a ICF can communicate with one other system. These ICFs tend to connect with a system that functions as a hub for ICF endpoints. That hub system then communicates with other hub systems, eventually leading to the target system.

A single packet has a transmission time of:

* About 5 milliseconds per hub + transmission time from start system location to start system ICF + end system ICF to end system location.

* To reduce communication delay between packet transfer from system location to the system's ICF, local ICFs will be constructed as well. Making that delay only be to the nearest ICF in the system.

### UTC (Universal Time Coordinated, Universal Clock):

The universal time it is everywhere in the galaxy. When sync interval exceeds 1 second, a system will typically start running on its own offline clock until the sync interval decreases again.

The offline clock has predictive measurements, relying on measuring acceleration, to track how fast you are traveling relative to the speed of the series of ICF hubs that track "online" UCT. Giving you an idea of how much time has passed.

### Biological resetting

DNA damage can be reset to be that of at birth, it's about a 30 minute process with the only side effects being that is makes you really hungry and dehydrated right after. For decades the process incredibly artificially inflated. Eventually - depending on the system & union, some made the process more affordable. The newest empire {INSERT CURRENT BIG EMPIRE NAME} also makes the price a fixed rate throughout their entire network. So that middle class citizens could afford it with a year's wages. {INSERT PRICE HERE} (however some thought the price would be free as some unions do).
