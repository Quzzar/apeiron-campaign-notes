_BC - Before the Collective, UTC - Universal Time Coordinated_

[[How the Universe Works]]

### (1200-1100 for Human / 1214 for Xel'nagan) BC - Interstellar Expansion

As far back as history remembers it, humanoids had slowly began to spread out in colonies throughout the galaxy - mainly by that of the type II civilizations: Humans and Xel'nagan.
Humans leaving from their home system: Tellus

Xel'naga leaving from their home system: Ihan-rii

While both are type II civilizations, the Xel'nagans were more advanced and far more ordered than their counterpart.

Quickly both civilizations ran into a problem, with each planet they occupied there immediately began an issue of control. With communication so slow, colony planets began to function basically autonomously to their home worlds.

And with Humans having less order than their Xel'naga counter part, their home world soon had it's own problems and eventual revolution with all their resources being spent off world on colonies that became more and more independent with every passing day and new colonies being built farther and farther away.

When the Humans had a home world revolution, much or their colony efforts and attention was lost. Effectively abandoning any last support they gave to most of their colonies.

These colonies, especially those who were 5+ LY away, were abandoned for over 50 years to fend for themselves in often hostile environments that relied on outside support. Many colonies died out, only the lucky few who survived were already on choice worlds but they were still technologically crippled.

That was the first incident that began a history of colony planets being fiercely independent. It wasn't until the invention of wormholes that allowed up to whole solar systems to be alright in relying on outside aid.

### 700-500 BC - Humans Discover Conrasu

Humanity finally reaches Septimus - a mysterious system containing 11 forested planets. On those planets they find the Conrasu people.

### 0 UTC - The Rise of the Collective:

Using the newly harnessed ability to read the state of a quantumly entangled particles with a device known as a "Kalvix Estimation Processor" or KEP for short, an organization later known as "the Collective" began work to create entangled particles and ship them across the traveled-galaxy on an industrial scale.

These entangled particles were then brought to and read throughout the universe, allowing real-time communication and order throughout the galaxy for the first time in history.

The Collective established a universal time measurement known as "UTC". Because of their historical significance, the terms "second", "minute", "hour", "day", "month", and "year" were still maintained and used but now tied to a constant ever-increasing value instead of any planetary activity.

A UTC day is 24 hours, month is 30 days, and year is 360 days.

In practice, if in system, "year" is usually referring to the system-year rather than universal-year. When on world, "day" and "month" are usually referring to world-year or world-month rather than universal-day or month.

In addition to implementing a universal time, the Collective established governance and order across the traveled-galaxy, greater than any other attempt at the time.

However, even with instantaneous communication, the incredibly distance between planets was still too great to maintain control.

Some claim that the Collective fell before they were even given a real chance to success as, while their empire was collapsing, they were in the final stages to creating a quantum teleporter but others argue that their quantum teleporter was still a far ways away from being even remotely commercially viable.

### 386 UCT - The Collective Falls:

The great but short lived empire falls and fractures into the independent peoples they once were.

They do keep some things, however: the UTC maintained, albeit now decentralized.

At first, while in times of chaos, the system is maintained by good faith but over the course of the next 70 years - as things stabilize into intersolar factions - a blockchain framework is developed to create a decentralized timekeeping system in order to maintain the UTC.

### ??? UCT - 
{Some other people tried and failed to establish rulership over various amounts of solar systems}

### ??? UCT - 
{Others maybe became very authoritarian or almost nihilistic in doctrine in that if they rebel, they will inevitably be killed.}

### ??? UTC - 
{Many became members of unions that all followed similar standards for the convenience of everyone. While the offer of protection wouldn't mean much in the event of war, tariffs and the MR industry access alone could still encourage systems to join a galactic union.}

### 851 UCT - Haloctric Computing Devices are invented:

End up playing a key part in space environments.

### 896 UCT - Anti-atmosphere and anti-friction HCDs are invented:

While not as good as standard HCDs in space, these new HCDs functioned just as well in space but could also function okay in an atmospheric setting; making them basically a strict upgrade.

### 952 UCT -

### 1001 UCT - At the turn of the century, Periluminal Containment Prisms were invented.

While being able to speed up to about 70% light-speed had been possible. Anything above 30% was to dangerous and unstable to maintain for reasonable amounts of time. The process of slowing down again was also a big problem.

But with the more recent invention of HCDs, it actually became possible to achieve this. With decades of trials and testing, eventually the Periluminal Containment Prism became a reality.

Functioning as a safety net around ships, they were finally able to realistically reach high percentages of light-speed.

Due to the high velocity and long distance of travel, the HCDs in Periluminal Containment Prisms were single-use only until N*HCDs were invented.

Also, even with anti-atmosphere HCDs, in-atmosphere deployment was still deemed far too risky to ever be done.

### 1494 UCT - Nanites and N*HCDs are invented

Having many uses in construction and warfare, nanites primarily were used in combination with HCDs to open the floodgates of possibilities.

### 1762 UCT - Warpgate tech is invented at the University of Keon.

The already falling-apart cybersynacy of Rajan decides they will invade the University of Keon in order to steal the research they have and prevent any other from gaining that knowledge.

In a blitzkrieg-fashion, they declare cyberwar on the university and instantly lock down their entire system. Preventing any kind of data communication.

They then physically made their way there and invaded the system and planet of Keon. And triggered a Complete Communication Collapse (aka a CCC).

These events caused outrage amongst neighboring empires as the university had always been neutral. Rajan was attacked and eventually destroyed but the technology was still coveted by those who got their hands on it.

### 1776 UCT - The United Galactic Commonwealth (GUC) forms:

See Organization entry.

### 1993 UCT - The GUC starts construction of the warpgate in Para.

Is planned to take about 20 years to complete.

### 2022 UCT - Current Day

The GUC just finished a warpgate to Para.  
The warpgate has a 50 year waitlist to go through. The current price of one-way entry for a ship is 2gp per 5 cubic feet + 350gp per life signature.
