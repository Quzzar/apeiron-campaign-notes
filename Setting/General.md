The universe: Apeiron, meaning "everything in its entirety - boundless without a beginning or end" in ancient Human.

The galaxy: Arkos, meaning "the cradle of existence" in ancient Xel'nagan.

Solar systems are on average about 1 light-year apart from each other but this region of Arkos is relatively clustered. There are clusters with the nearest solar system 0.02 light-years apart and others with the nearest 15 light-years apart.

While humans do still exist, most have spread out to the far reaching of the galaxy where they live in isolated groups or have become immortal bags of flesh.
