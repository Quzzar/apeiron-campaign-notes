For this game we are in a universe very similar to our own but in the distant future. The universe is called Apeiron, meaning "everything in its entirety - boundless without a beginning or end" in ancient Human. I'd imagine we will be spending the entire game inside the same Sa galaxy called Arkos, meaning "the cradle of existence" in ancient Xel'nagan. 

Overtime humanoids from different planets have slowly traveled and mixed to create diverse galactic companies/organizations/nations throughout the galaxy. While Humans and Xel'naga were the first ancestries to explore the galaxy beyond their own solar systems, today - as of 2022 UTC - they are both basically extinct. Humans mixed and diversified into other peoples and the Xel'naga disappeared long ago. The only "pure" Humans today are effectively immortal sheets of flesh (as the Human mind, unfortunately, was quite prone to [[Phycological Decay]]).

These days the galaxy is split up into a few major organizations: 

The setting is high-tech, low-fantasy. You are allowed to select most options options

As for content and mechanics, I wanted to use the the community-developed [Starfinder 2e](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wvPLqNOQsHvDcpu8T8h-vva8YlAp6ma1) system (which is a conversion of Starfinder using Pathfinder 2e's core mechanics) but found the project wasn't quite complete enough to use in a game yet.
As a result, I've decided to go with Pathfinder 2e but I'll be altering a few things:

We are using the following variant rules:
- Free Archetype
- Proficiency Without Level
- Moral Intentions

We are also using the following homebrew:
- [Apeiron Campaign](https://wanderersguide.app/homebrew/?view_id=771) - Key: _b0fd72af-436d-458a-b310-83eac1d9897c_
- [Time and Space Magic](https://wanderersguide.app/homebrew/?view_id=311)
- [Solarian Class](https://wanderersguide.app/homebrew/?view_id=99)
- [Starfinder 2e Variant](https://wanderersguide.app/homebrew/?view_id=641)
 - You are also encouraged to look at Starfinder (or other Sci-Fi systems) for additional material. I'm open to using other homebrew as long as it fits the specific setting.

In addition, there's some basic information / rules that we'll have:
- On most items, the magical trait will be replaced by the tech trait.
- Nowadays almost all modern armor will come with at least a basic [[Energy Shields | Energy Shield]]. This is represented as an armor property rune. Energy shields give the wearer a huge resistance against non-tech weapons (this is because modern day tech weapons will almost certainly have [[Anti-N-HCD mechanism]]s built into them).
- If someone doesn't have any form of energy shield, they take a -4 penalty to AC against high velocity ranged attacks.
