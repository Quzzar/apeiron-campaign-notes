## History - Name

The primary planet of this system was the [[Oread]]'s home planet - known as Qarod (Ka-rod) in the Oread's native language (Arabic-influenced).

The Oread didn't really have a term for their solar system since they never left planet. When asked, they called their system "Qarod Doran" - meaning Realm of Qarod.

When it was later colonized by the [[Dan Hasner Group]] (the DHG) in 982 UCT. The org of humans named the system Valrin VI - being the 6th system they found in the Valrin cluster.

After the DHG left, the system became an independent colony and kept the name Valrin VI.

Later in 1993 UCT, the United Galactic Commonwealth (the GUC) announce their plans to construct a warpgate to the system. Meaning the independent system would join the Commonwealth. With it they rebranded the system calling it Para.

## History - People & Culture

When the DHG began to colonize Para B, the strong-willed Oread people fought back against them. But the Oread were medieval technology-wise, they couldn't compete. Most died out and the few remaining had their old ways of surviving stripped away from them: the gemstone caves and dust prairies that they once thrived in were strip mined away.

With no home to go back to, the Oread had to rely on the very people who took it from them to survive. However, the DHG had all of their technology genome-locked. Making it so the Oread literally couldn't use their technology and survive without being genetically spliced with humans - which some of them did.

 - The Oreads of today are mostly Oread-[[Human]] hybrids. Some, as a form of further trying to dilute the remaining human genome, have worked to try and remove their human splice (Oread-[[Fleshwarp]]). Others have instead respliced themselves with other ancestries: ex. Oread-[[Skeleton]], Oread-[[Kobold]], Oread-[[Hobgoblin]], Oread-[[Automaton]].

When the DHG first came to Para, Para C was a desert wasteland planet. They began terraforming the planet in order to make it habitable enough for mining companies to permanently colonize the planet.

Once the DHG left and Para formed its own independence, the terraforming of Para C continued. During this time Para became more focused on increasing the trade of its precious minerals and becoming a trading hub for the region.

Various ancestries came to live in the system, slowly diluting the once dominant human population. Eventually the point where it is today: humans aren't around anymore.

During this time Para C became more and more lush and green. The planet now is seen as a minor paradise of the region. All while Para B, the original primary planet, is a bit too hot to enjoy a similar climate.
