### The Collective Falls

The great but short lived empire falls and fractures into the independent peoples they once were.

They do keep some things, however: the UTC maintained, albeit now decentralized.

At first, while in times of chaos, the system is maintained by good faith but over the course of the next 70 years - as things stabilize into intersolar factions - a blockchain framework is developed to create a decentralized timekeeping system in order to maintain the UTC.



TODO - Add these times

### ??? UCT - 
{Some other people tried and failed to establish rulership over various amounts of solar systems}

### ??? UCT - 
{Others maybe became very authoritarian or almost nihilistic in doctrine in that if they rebel, they will inevitably be killed.}

### ??? UTC - 
{Many became members of unions that all followed similar standards for the convenience of everyone. While the offer of protection wouldn't mean much in the event of war, tariffs and the MR industry access alone could still encourage systems to join a galactic union.}
