### At the turn of the century, Periluminal Containment Prisms were invented.

While being able to speed up to about 70% light-speed had been possible. Anything above 30% was to dangerous and unstable to maintain for reasonable amounts of time. The process of slowing down again was also a big problem.

But with the more recent invention of [[Haloctric Computing Device | HCDs]], it actually became possible to achieve this. With decades of trials and testing, eventually the [[Periluminal Containment Prism]] became a reality.

Functioning as a safety net around ships, they were finally able to realistically reach high percentages of light-speed.

Due to the high velocity and long distance of travel, the HCDs in Periluminal Containment Prisms were single-use only until [[Nanite-infused Haloctric Computing Device | N*HCDs]] were invented.

Also, even with anti-atmosphere HCDs, in-atmosphere deployment was still deemed far too risky to ever be done.
