### Interstellar Expansion

As far back as history remembers it, humanoids had slowly began to spread out in colonies throughout the galaxy - mainly by that of the type II civilizations: [[Human | Humans]] and [[Xel'naga | Xel'nagan]].

During this time Xel'naga leave from their home system: [[Ihan-rii]]

While the Humans and Xel'naga are both type II civilizations, the Xel'nagan were more advanced and far more ordered than their counterpart.

Quickly the Xel'naga ran into a problem, with each planet they occupied there immediately began an issue of control. With communication so slow, colony planets began to function basically autonomously to their home world.

However, due to the incredibly ordered and lawful fashion of Xel'naga society, their colonies were able to stay as colonies for what is believed to be at least 400 hundred of years - potentially much longer. TODO - TO ADD.
