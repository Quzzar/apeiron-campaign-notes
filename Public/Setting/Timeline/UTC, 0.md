### The Rise of the Collective

Using the newly harnessed ability to read the state of a quantumly entangled particles with a device known as a "Kalvix Estimation Processor" or KEP for short, an organization later known as "the Collective" began work to create entangled particles and ship them across the traveled-galaxy on an industrial scale.

These entangled particles were then brought to and read throughout the universe, allowing real-time communication and order throughout the galaxy for the first time in history.

The Collective established a universal time measurement known as "UTC". Because of their historical significance, the terms "second", "minute", "hour", "day", "month", and "year" were still maintained and used but now tied to a constant ever-increasing value instead of any planetary activity.

A UTC day is 24 hours, month is 30 days, and year is 360 days.

In practice, if in system, "year" is usually referring to the system-year rather than universal-year. When on world, "day" and "month" are usually referring to world-year or world-month rather than universal-day or month.

In addition to implementing a universal time, the Collective established governance and order across the traveled-galaxy, greater than any other attempt at the time.

However, even with instantaneous communication, the incredibly distance between planets was still too great to maintain control.

Some claim that the Collective fell before they were even given a real chance to success as, while their empire was collapsing, they were in the final stages to creating a quantum teleporter but others argue that their quantum teleporter was still a far ways away from being even remotely commercially viable.
