### [[Warptech]] is invented at the University of Keon.

The already falling-apart the [[Cyberocracy]] of [[Rajan]] decides they will invade the University of [[Keon]] in order to steal the research they have and prevent any other from gaining that knowledge.

In a blitzkrieg-fashion, they declare cyberwar on the university and instantly lock down their entire system. Preventing any kind of data communication.

They then physically made their way there and invaded the system and planet of Keon. And triggered a [[Complete Communication Collapse]].

These events caused outrage amongst neighboring empires as the university had always been neutral. Rajan was attacked and eventually destroyed but the technology was still coveted by those who got their hands on it.
