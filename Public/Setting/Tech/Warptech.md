### Aka [[Warpgate]] tech

Finally solved/invented at the University of [[Keon]], warptech is a very complex field of mathematics that is all about working out how to transmute spacetime. It requires having a solid grasp of actually understanding how dimensions work. Unfortunately, most species can't really comprehend anything beyond the 3rd dimension - most notably [[Human]]s. And it was for that reason why some believe cracking this technical feat took such a long time, it required humans to no longer be on the center stage and forefront of innovation.

At the moment, only really one invention has been created using warptech: Warpgates.
