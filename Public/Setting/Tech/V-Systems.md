In recent development, using Hydrotechnocrophy to coat a strip of Naronium in an Ion Wrapper allows the manipulation of stray electrons to access a 5th state of Naronium.

V-systems, or penta-computers are quinary systems with V-quids. Still in development.

An issue with them is it's much harder to convert base-5 instructions to base-2 than it is to convert base-4 to base-2. Also, a quark only have 4 states. Base-5 instructions would also have to be converted to base-4 if they were being sent off-system.
