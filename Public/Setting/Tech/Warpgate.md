It takes about 30 years to built a warpgate once the materials are all together. In that time, many people will be buying property, planning construction projects, researching profitable regions in the system, and setting themselves up for when the warpgate is constructed so that they can make a bunch of money.

As a result, once the gate is complete there's about a 50 year waitlist for the queue to go through and the price is outrageously expensive.
