Without physically traveling there, you can enter into something like AR/VR and be projected into reality. All senses can signaled back to you. Which really begs the question, what's the difference between this and actually just being there?

People will often pay to use MR setups and visit other systems. Where they control a hologram projection bot or droid (but looks like them to them). The experience feels very real but it just makes all the more crushing of a blow when they enter back into dreaded reality.

MR is the equivalent of tourism.

MR is generally more secure than [[Virtual Reality Devices | VR]] as MR almost always requires an authenticated data pipeline while VR has a lot of unsecure sites.
