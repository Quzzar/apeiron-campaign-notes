### Also known as: N\*HCD or just HCD

With some nanites added to the mix, it allows some finetuned control of the [[Haloctric Computing Device | HCD]] cloud. As a 3rd party entity in the mixture, nanites can send back analytics about the state of the HCD. They can function as security and defend to the cloud from threats. They can even move around sections of the HCD to fix or optimize. Historically, HCDs were designed to be self-correcting but, with nanites there to help as well, the device is much more consistent and optimal.

As nanites are much more expensive, N\*HCDs are almost always reusable.
