### Aka [[Holtzman]] Shields

The modern day energy shield is made up of a [[Holtzman Field]] which works to stop matter passing through the field.

There are also [[Disintegration Shields]] which function the same, however, in addition to trying to stop matter from passing through, they also work to destroy the matter that's passing through.
