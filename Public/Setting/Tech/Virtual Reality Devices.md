With a VR setup, you can walk around and feel like you're living in a virtual space. With modern day graphics and hardware, it can be quite convincing!

This is due partially to the abundance of bots and dishonest nature of the internet, partially because of the resurgence of physical space due to the hype around [[Warptech]] and the [[United Galactic Commonwealth]].
