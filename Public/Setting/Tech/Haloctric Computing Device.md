### Also known as: HCD or old HCD


Older tech, invented in 851 UCT.

Using chlorine-based complex halogenidesÂ and germanium dust, "simple" technological devices can be creating and dispersed in a cloud of gas.

The cloud functions affectively as a computer albeit spread amongst a variable amount of space.

The notes below this point only pertain to standard HCDs invented in 851 - not [[Nanite-infused Haloctric Computing Device | nanite-infused HCDs]] or N\*HCDs.

With "quick" firing mechanisms, a HCD can be released in about 6 seconds and then takes about 6 seconds to align.

Originally HCDs were only designed to function in space because, while in an atmosphere, the gases in the atmosphere would function as an insulator. The atmosphere would also push the HCD cloud around at an unpredictable way. But anti-atmosphere and anti-friction HCDs were later invented in 896 UCT.

Most HCDs are single-use, however some more advanced systems are reusable and take about 1 minute to collect again.

Such advanced systems were only reusable in space. If ever used in atmosphere, the recollection system would not function properly.
