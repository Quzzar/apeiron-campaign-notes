While illegal in most systems, some people have uploaded their mind into a computer, often in order to avoid phycological decay, but digital thoughts aren't truly the same. They're known as a digital humanoid and they're always lawful.

Since their entire consciousness is digital, digital humanoids can be transferred over the internet. Such practice is seen as the equivalent of illegal immigration - as a result becoming a digital humanoid is generally illegal as well.

However, there are always cases of people - who are rich enough - being able to gain passage. In such cases bribery or some kind of compliance with both sides is acquired. As obfuscation probably isn't worth the risk as, if even a section is caught, complete personal corruption would occur.
