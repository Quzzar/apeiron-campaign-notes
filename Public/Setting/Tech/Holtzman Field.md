Using [[Nanite-infused Haloctric Computing Device | N*HCD]] technology, it is specific design and layout of N\*HCDs that effectively creates an incredibly optimized wall that stops any unwanted matter from passing through.

The invention of this technology is often claimed as the greatest of the many revolutionary use cases of N\*HCDs. When first created, Holtzman fields were incredibly sought-after which then lead to a wave of bans. It wasn't until governments and companies had a monopoly on the technology that it started seeing more use by private parties.
