Microscopic computers that can perform basic activities. Nanites have existed in many forms for thousands of years. But historically they've had very basic in functionality - using material and mechanical engineering to intuitively create functionality - and/or incredibly expensive.

There's also been concerns with toxicity of nanites in biological systems. As a result, the idea of nanites was fa√ßade for quite some time before they became practical.
