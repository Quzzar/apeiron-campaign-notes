Using a Kalvix Estimation Processor (KEP), large facilities (known as ICFs - Interstellar Communication Facility) would read a single entangled particle as it flips - creating a binary signal that travels instantaneously across the traveled-galaxy.

Overtime KEPs were optimized and shrank in size and upkeep costs but the single entangled particle became the biggest issue to the technology.

The technology relied on the two entangled particles having an isolated wave function from the universe around it. If either particle ever became observed of affect by anything around it, the particle's wave function would collapse / merge and a new particle would need to be shipped across the galaxy.

A local ICF is an ICF that contains an entangled particle whose end particle is not in another system but within the same system. It's best for quick planet-to-plant communication.

* **Complete Communication Collapse (CCC)** - If the single entangled quark touches or interacts with anything, its wave function would collapse. Ending all communication. A new entangled quark would have to be acquired from light-years away. This is one of the worst things that could occur to a solar system.

Because each particle itself was precious in this technology, for quite a while quantum teleportation and quantum reconfiguration was very much out of the realm of possibility.

* **Quantum Reconfiguration** - Sure, you could flip the right quarks to turn Hydrogen into Tennessine but the process would take more time and energy than the process of just producing Tennessine outright would.

* **Quantum Teleportation** - More difficult than Quantum Reconfiguration, Quantum Teleportation is still a possibility but it still seem as far too difficult. Brings up more moral questions about individualism than anything else.
