Rajan is a [[Cyberocracy]] that always prized itself on its behemoth of an industry and advanced technology. The org entered its golden era around [[UTC, 1500]] with the invention of [[Nanites]] (which Rajan worked to mass produce).

For a while it seemed like Rajan was the best place to live in the galaxy, [[Tourism]] was huge for the org. However, a cyberocracy is only as great as it is up-to-date with the times. The government systems became outdated and the systems to update them were slow. And nanites, the technology that rose Rajan to power, eventually became soporiferous both in interest and technological advances.

With the advent of [[Warptech]] Rajan knew it was their moment to jump on the technology, it was going to be their nanites all over again. However, it didn't work out that way.

### Keon-Rajan Wars
Rajan invaded the University of [[Keon]] in order to steal their warptech research and prevent any others from gaining that knowledge. In a blitzkrieg-fashion, they declare cyberwar on the university and instantly lock down their entire system. Preventing any kind of data communication.
They then physically made their way there and invaded the system and planet of Keon. And triggered a [[Complete Communication Collapse]].

These events caused outrage amongst neighboring empires as the university had always been neutral. Rajan was attacked by the [[Dynastic Nekkarian Confederacy]], the [[Sabik Company]], and [[Procyon]]. They conquered a majority of Rajan's territory then eventually abandoned that territory (because it's too unrealistic trying to hold onto territory so far away).

Rajan never claimed back most of the territory that was taken from them and abandoned. Those systems had most of their infrastructure destroyed and with the tarifs imposed onto Rajan after the war, they couldn't afford to expand and rebuilt those systems again.

Instead Rajan focused inward and stagnated, corruption started to take over their government and concerns of [[True AI]]s ran rampant.

The [[United Galactic Commonwealth]] would later make strides to claim some of the territory Rajan once had.
