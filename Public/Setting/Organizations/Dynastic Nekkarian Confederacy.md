A militaristic and authoritative organization promoting technology and innovation. Think Russia. Has a [[Dyson Sphere]] lattice around their sun - resulting in a relatively cold system. But with an abundance of power.

They're also working on building [[Warpgate]]s.

The DNC formed from their original home system of [[Nekkar]], a vibrant trade hub of all various peoples. Neighboring the Human's home system of [[Tellus]], Nekkar had a history of being a great middle ground between the systems that are in what is now known as the [[Nekkarian Belt]].

When the DNC formed, it did so with the intent of uniting all the systems in the Nekkarian Belt - including Tellus.

But after their war with [[Procyon]] ended with Procyon dropping a [[Wurren]] onto the surface of Nekkar's primary planet and planet the system is named after, the DNC's home system was moved to Tellus.

Since being moved to Tellus, the DNC has embraced a strong dogmatic, authoritarian presence. The completion of their dyson sphere gave them near-limitless energy at the cost of a large amount of natural light in the system. The [[Ysoki]] must have enjoyed such an environment as, over the course of a couple hundred years, Ysoki went from being a minor outsider-ancestry to the majority ancestry in the system.

Today Ysoki account for 85% of the population.
