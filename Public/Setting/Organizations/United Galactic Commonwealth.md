An [[Algocracy]] that is using the recent advancements of [[Warptech | spacetime transmutation]] to create [[Warpgate]]s throughout the traveled-galaxy. With each new warpgate they built, a new system joins their union.

The founders being brilliant inventors and a soldier in the Keon-Rajan wars who happened to get their hands on warptech, the Commonwealth was formed on a small moon of [[Mircio]] in the [[Tropali]] system.

They eventually expanded and took over Tropali, making the system the Commonwealth's home.

With fair taxes, tariffs, and liberal fundamental rights, the algocracy worked to make more warpgates in other systems - for the first time making their borders not defined by region or distance.
