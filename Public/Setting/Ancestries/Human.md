Humans. The basic b. They come from the system and planet known as [[Tellus]].

Very slowly Humans started expanding from their system to the rest of the galaxy. They are credited for most significant exploration discoveries and they "discovered" a lot of different peoples and ancestries.

However, overtime, Humans mixed and diversified with these other peoples. And the Humans who could afford to [[Biological Resetting | "live forever"]] soon discovered that, unfortunately, Humans are particularly prone to [[Phycological Decay]].

Today, the only "pure" Humans today are effectively immortal sheets of flesh. But you can still see bits of Human in various people.
