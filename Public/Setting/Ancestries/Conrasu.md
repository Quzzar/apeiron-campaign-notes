Found on all 11 of forested planets of the [[Septimus]] system, Conrasu are peculiar individuals and with only a few traveling beyond their home system. Originally taken and collected as a trophy of discovery, people came to understand that these creatures are quite intelligent and deserve their own rights.

It is said that the Conrasu of Septimus have protected their home system and kept it almost exactly the same as when it was first discovered by [[Human]]s.
